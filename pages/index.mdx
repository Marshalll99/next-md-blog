Hey, I'm a beginner in web development at production level. I enjoy working with Netlify and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
